# Phase-3-Project

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
In the rapidly evolving telecommunications industry, customer churn is a critical concern for companies seeking to maintain profitability and sustainable growth. In this project, the focus is on SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, and the objective is to build a binary classification model to predict whether a customer is likely to discontinue their services soon. The audience for this analysis is primarily the telecom business itself, with a keen interest in identifying patterns that could help reduce customer churn and mitigate financial losses. By leveraging predictive modeling techniques, we aim to provide insights into the factors influencing customer attrition and deliver a tool that can enhance strategic decision-making.

# BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
In the context of the telecom industry, building a predictive model to forecast customer churn for SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, is crucial for business sustainability and growth. Identifying patterns that precede customer attrition allows SyriaTel to proactively address potential issues and retain valuable customers. The predictive model aims to assess how effectively it can anticipate customer churn, providing insights into the factors influencing retention. This understanding is pivotal for SyriaTel's management, enabling informed decision-making to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. Insights into the significance of various features in predicting churn contribute to strategic planning, allowing SyriaTel to allocate resources efficiently and tailor retention strategies. Recommendations derived from the model offer actionable insights into specific scenarios where predictions are most useful, guiding the business in adapting variables to achieve targeted outcomes. Ultimately, this predictive approach empowers SyriaTel to implement preemptive measures, reduce customer churn, and foster long-term relationships with its clientele.

# DATA UNDERSTANDING
The dataset, obtained from SyriaTel Telecommunications Company, comprises 3,333 rows and 21 columns, providing comprehensive information about customer attributes and usage patterns. The columns encompass a range of variables, including both numerical features like account length, voicemail messages, and call-related metrics, as well as categorical features such as international plan, voicemail plan, and state. The dataset also incorporates a Boolean variable indicating churn, crucial for the binary classification task. A thorough review of the dataset reveals the absence of duplicates, missing values, or null entries, ensuring the dataset's cleanliness and completeness. Additionally, no outliers were identified, suggesting the dataset is well-structured and ready for further exploratory analysis and predictive modeling to understand and address customer churn in the telecommunications domain.

# MODELING
The development of an effective binary classification model for predicting customer churn involves a comprehensive approach that encompasses data preparation, feature engineering, model selection, and rigorous evaluation. Throughout this process, a blend of domain knowledge, data expertise, and a deep understanding of machine learning techniques is paramount. Performance assessment of the models, employing key classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, revealed nuanced insights. The initial logistic regression model demonstrated a commendable accuracy of approximately 85.97%, yet faced challenges in precision and recall, especially concerning the identification of churn instances. The K-Nearest Neighbors model surpassed with an accuracy of about 88.37%, but exhibited an imbalance in precision and recall for churn cases. The final logistic regression model, incorporating hyper-parameter tuning and under-sampling, achieved an accuracy of approximately 74.82%. Despite being lower than the KNN model, it struck a more balanced precision and recall for both churn and non-churn instances, signifying its effectiveness in addressing class imbalance and accurately capturing churn instances. In the realm of predicting customer churn, where precision and recall hold particular importance, the final logistic regression model showcased a well-balanced performance, emphasizing its suitability for practical applications in the telecommunications domain.

# EVALUATION
The combined insights from univariate and bivariate analyses underscored the significance of addressing class imbalances for accurate model predictions in the context of customer churn. Notably, the data revealed regional variations and usage patterns influencing churn risk, emphasizing the importance of geographic and behavioral factors. The modeling phase validated these insights, with the initial logistic regression highlighting challenges in identifying churn instances, the K-Nearest Neighbors model showing higher accuracy but an imbalance in precision and recall, and the final logistic regression, with hyper-parameter tuning and under-sampling, achieving a more balanced performance. Precision and recall emerged as critical metrics in predicting customer churn, emphasizing the need for models that strike a balance aligning with specific business goals. The findings offer actionable recommendations for targeted interventions, pricing adjustments, and regional strategies to enhance customer retention and satisfaction in the telecommunications sector.

# CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the comprehensive journey from exploratory data analysis to predictive modeling has provided valuable insights into the complex dynamics of customer churn in the telecommunications industry. The analyses revealed critical factors influencing churn, including class imbalances, usage patterns, regional variations, and the trade-offs between model accuracy and the ability to capture churn instances accurately. The final logistic regression model, refined through hyper-parameter tuning and under-sampling, emerged as a balanced solution, showcasing its suitability for predicting customer churn with improved precision and recall. The findings not only contribute to a nuanced understanding of customer behavior but also offer actionable recommendations for targeted interventions, pricing strategies, and regional-specific approaches to enhance customer retention and satisfaction. This comprehensive approach aligns with the goal of developing effective strategies for reducing churn and maximizing customer loyalty in the competitive landscape of the telecommunications business.
