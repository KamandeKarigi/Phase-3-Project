# Phase-3-Project

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
In the rapidly evolving telecommunications industry, customer churn is a critical concern for companies seeking to maintain profitability and sustainable growth. In this project, the focus is on SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, and the objective is to build a binary classification model to predict whether a customer is likely to discontinue their services soon. The audience for this analysis is primarily the telecom business itself, with a keen interest in identifying patterns that could help reduce customer churn and mitigate financial losses. By leveraging predictive modeling techniques, we aim to provide insights into the factors influencing customer attrition and deliver a tool that can enhance strategic decision-making.
